# week2_project_accessible_image_gallery

I found this week's project quite difficult and overwhelming, particularly with writing the logic behind the functions in Javascript. As you will see I tried to break down the solution using pseudo code and it's something I need to keep practising. I feel I have achieved the main requirements of the project. Adding media queries was mentioned in both the basic requirements and the stretch goals so I wasn't sure if they were different requests but I only had time to implement a media query on my thumbnail, which dynamically changes as you resize. I have also added ARIA labels as part of the stretch goals.

I used MDN and GeeksforGeeks as sources of information and assistance, and also asked family members who have coding knowledge for help. I also used StackOverflow to look for solutions to similar problems other people had, and to try and understand some of the errors I was having.
